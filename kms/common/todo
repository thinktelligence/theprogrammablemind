show -> show what
show verb + show noun -> choose the noun if default?
implement equals as a separate things from is / same with hierarchy
"spell checking"
macros?
do an expert system next
synonnyms of restart -> reset clear
use getWord + the names of things instead of food in the item
23 the cost -> greg mcclement the person -> etc  -> write an operators for "(([instance]) op ([generalization]))


dimension should say 10 degrees celciss not 10 celcius
make semantics by default no support evalaute you have to 
2 doubles combos <<<<<<<<<<<<<
listable does not mean a list it means the elements in the list operator like a single operator
in the client dont write the logs unless they are going to be shown
initializerFn has api but semantic apply has api that is different / also km / kms need to bey synced
sort the hierarchy properties
finish up the word override implementation in gdefaults
load ordering -> dont allow any add after the API is set. then the API can assume all the KM's are present
time_dimension
generalize list on the server side+
in tpmkms -> load kms with a function call to not have them all loaded for every require of tpmkms
work on ask.js

have failures on the match/apply side turn in to data that can go to the client for why questions

make all the km names either plural or singular. properties/concept/hierarchy
for check -> has a mask of sub propertyes to be interested in / selector fucntion or something
what is greg's weight in pounds
release nodes
finish up time_dimension
show weight in pounds
get degree out of dimension
in numbers do real/integer etc
show numbers to two decimal places
height is a length greg's height is 10 pounds
for failures on the server side put a reason in the context. like 27.2 in 27.2 pm expected an integer between 1 and 12
use the metric system
10 feet + 12 inches
show distance as feet inches
switch and from same to convolutions
fix logging toe log.warn/log.error/log.info
fix the no level warning
get rid of level as an arg in Operator(
break Matcher_Type into Matcher_Type and Matcher_Variable
fix the path in config_test to pull from current dir
fix dump priorities to not use ordinals or lookup shit?
get rid of inputss + outputs from IO just use digraph
types in the client side using ['reason', 0] notation instead of 'reason#0' notation
solve singlar/plural overrides better see it.*what
clean up all the priorities being set
clean up all the associations being set
makeObject -> ignore unknown as a type
move listable + asList out of client into dialogues
update flatten/uflatten to paramerize list
add tests for animals
deal with the associations from tests

XXX move ask out of client into dialogs or somethign
XXX make it so first element in priorities is the highest since I keep doing that
DONE auto mark contexts as dead if there is no operator? what about ...after deal with it later
DONE for -rt print out paraphrases that are different as warning
XXX no api passed to initializer -> do it
XXX no config passed to initializer -> ???
XXX no km/kms passed to initializer -> pass apis + error out on use in before
XXX add addAPI to initializer config
XXX fix initializeFn args bs
XXX get rid of list based generators and semantics
DONE finish level in json
DONE types not having dups
DONE types containing the full operator
XXX have test check parenthesize output
XXX fix up localHierarchy to take new notation
XXX add level in the generators + semantics
XXX convert hierarchy to use level
XXX get rid of max_operators
XXX reworkd levelSpecificHierarchy
XXX convert all the throws in client to use an object no strings
XXX TEMPLATE -> get rid of the template files?
